# Reduction of Toil In Upcommerce Ticketing Systems
Concerns have been raised about the excessive number of tickets generated within Upcommerce along with substantial time engineers spend monitoring our systems to uphold our SLAs. To alleviate these issues and streamline our ticketing processes, thus freeing up engineers to focus on critical incidents like the recent outage,  we propose implementing the following services.

Datadog for System and Application Health monitoring, PagerDuty to handle incident responses, and Zendesk to assist in ticket generation and organization.
